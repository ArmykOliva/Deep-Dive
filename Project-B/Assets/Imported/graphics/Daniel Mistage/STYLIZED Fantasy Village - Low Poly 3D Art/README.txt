Hello! Thank you for purchasing this set. Don’t forget to check out my store, where you’ll find more sets to combine with this package.


 Below, I will explain how it works:



- To understand how the assets in this set work, it is necessary to check the “ShowcaseScene_2” scene (Scenes > ShowcaseScene_2), where the construction of a structure is divided into steps. Each step includes pieces with a green material, which identifies the new pieces added to the structure. You can select the objects from the Inspector to locate their folder and observe the other prefabs that are in it to become familiar with them. This scene shows the procedure for creating a two-story structure using the most commonly used assets in this set. I recommend inspecting the other structures (Prefabs > Buildings > Preset Buildings) if you need more examples.

- Some pieces include variations with different sizes to create larger or smaller spaces within a structure. You can find roofs, floors, supports, and other pieces with different measurements. I recommend scaling objects if you consider it necessary.

- Some modular assets have pivot points in places that allow them to be scaled more easily and use fewer pieces in a structure. Example: Floors, roofs, supports, stairs, pillars.

- Materials can be switched in assets that have a roof. This set includes an orange and blue color that can be easily switched (“MAIN MATERIAL” for blue and “ROOF_BRICK” for orange). You can also edit the texture and add your own colors through Photoshop or other design software.

- In the “Fake Buildings” folder, you will find modular assets that will allow you to create empty structures that will serve as filler in your environment.

- The “Building Attachables” folder contains objects that can be used to decorate structures. Some objects can be used for other types of decorations. Check out “Exterior Scene” to see some examples.

- Some objects include small pieces so they can be animated or used in another context.

- The “Stairs” folder includes prefabricated stairs in different ways. Within this folder, you will also find small pieces so you can make your own and use them in other ways; these pieces have pivot points positioned so they can be scaled.

- The water and cloud shaders were created with Shader Graph. Its installation is necessary for them to be observed in the project (Windows > Package Manager > Package: Unity Registry > Shader Graph).
