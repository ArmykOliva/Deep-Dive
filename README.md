You have but one mission...

Dive to the center of the Earth
Accompanying you in this journey is a friend.

Your Robot Assistant...
Evie, is an energetic party lover tasked with guiding you through the depths of the ocean. She will show you the ropes and help you the best she can - with banter. 

Fight & Fix
Create different kinds of ammunition using different ores and load your guns to fight hordes of enemies throughout your journey. 

Also make sure to keep your submarine in order. Stop floods by fixing the leakages to keep you from sinking - after all, even Evie doesn't like drowning.
